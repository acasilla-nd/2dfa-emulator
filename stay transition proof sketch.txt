The idea behind the proof for why 2dfas are not as powerful without stay transitions is as follows:
Assume that there were some conversion between 2dfas with stay transitions and those without that preserved the movement and checks
(which is pretty much necessary for it to be an actual conversion, because otherwise you could just reduce the original 2dfa to skip those
checks and you would have a valid 2dfa with stay transitions for the problem again)
If you want to simulate the stay transition while the other head moves, you have to have some movement that changes the relative parity of the tape heads
because they will always be either both odd or both even if they both have to move 1 at a time. The only way to keep one still is by having it touch
the edge of the tape and attempt to move into it. But if the tape heads are at some arbitrary locations n and m which which are greater than the
number of states in the 2dfa without stay transitions (possible for an input of arbitrarily large length), then the 2dfa cannot keep track of the current
position using enumeration of states, and it cannot write to the tape to keep track of its original position. So it will not be able to go back after
touching the edge of the state.
Therefore, 2dfas without stay transitions are not as powerful and cannot simulate a 2dfa with stay transitions.
